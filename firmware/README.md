# NSGadget for Trinket M0

The source code for this firmware is at
https://github.com/gdsports/HID/tree/horipad. This is a fork of the NicoHood
Arduino HID library.

Compiled programs can be burned into the Trinket M0 just by dragging and
dropping a UF2 file on to the Trinket M0 USB drive. There is no need to install
the Arduino IDE, source code, or USB serial device driver.

* Download the UF2 file.
* Plug in the Trinket M0 to the computer.
* Double tap the Trinket M0 reset button.
* When the TRINKETBOOT USB drive appears, drop the UF2 file on to the drive.
* Wait a few seconds until the Trinket M0 reboots.
